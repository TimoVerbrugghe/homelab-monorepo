## This playbook sets up proxmox hosts to passthrough iGPU, install ubuntu cloudinit templates & uses terraform to deploy vms based on these templates
## This playbook will deploy 2 types of VMs: iGPU VM (where there are additional steps taken to install intel drivers and passthrough the iGPU) and "standard" VMs
