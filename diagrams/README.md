# Diagrams

This folder contains visual representations of the homelab architecture and components.  
All diagrams are created and maintained with draw.io.

## Conventions

- Source files use the `.drawio` (or `.drawio.png`) format.
- Export static images (PNG/SVG) if needed for documentation.
- Update diagrams when infrastructure changes.

## Editing

Open diagrams via <https://drawio.com>.
