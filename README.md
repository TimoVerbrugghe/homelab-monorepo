# homelab-monorepo

## UNDER CONSTRUCTION ##

This repository contains all my setup files while I'm learning Ansible, Kubernetes, NixOS & Terraform. Trying to move over to a more advanced homelab setup.

Heavily influenced by TechnoTim (<https://github.com/techno-tim>) & Christian Lempa (<https://github.com/ChristianLempa/christianlempa>)
