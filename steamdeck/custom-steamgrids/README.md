# Custom Steam Grids for Steam Deck

This folder contains custom artwork for classic PC games installed on my Steam Deck (SteamOS). The artwork is similar to what you can find on [steamgriddb.com](https://www.steamgriddb.com/), but tailored for my collection.

## Artwork Types

Steam uses several types of images for game presentation:

- **Capsule**: Vertical game poster (`600x900`)
- **Wide Capsule**: Horizontal poster for Big Picture mode (`920x430`)
- **Hero**: Banner shown at the top when a game is selected (`3840x1240`)
- **Logo**: Transparent logo overlayed on the hero image (`1200x705`)
- **Icon**: Square image for overlays and menus (minimum `16x16`, any square size)

## Creation Process

Most artwork here was upscaled or enhanced using AI tools such as [bigjpg.com](https://bigjpg.com/).
