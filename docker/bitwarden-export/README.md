# A docker container to export your bitwarden vault

This is a docker container that runs a bash script to export your vault & organization vaults to an UNENCRYPTED json file. I'm personally running this container as part of a kubernetes CronJob.

## Usage

Docker container needs the following environment variables

- BW_CLIENTID (Client ID that you get from the api key in your account settings on bitwarden)
- BW_CLIENTSECRET (Client Secret that you get from the api key in your account settings on bitwarden)
- BW_SERVER (URL to your bitwarden server)
- BW_PASSWORD (Your bitwarden password)
- (Optional) BW_APPID - This allows you to set a static application ID so that you don't get an email from bitwarden everytime you export (because without APPID set, a random one will be generated each time, which will trigger Bitwarden to send you an email that a new device has connected to your vault)
