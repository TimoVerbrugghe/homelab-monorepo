# Security hardening audit (non-utilities namespaces)

## Scope

This audit covers all hardened workload manifests, including `kubernetes/utilities/` and
`kubernetes/utilities-priv/`.

## Notes

### Manifest-scoped equivalents used here

- `tty/stdin disabled` means each workload container and applicable initContainer explicitly sets `stdin: false` and `tty: false` in the pod spec.
- `/tmp isolated` means the workload already had a dedicated `/tmp` backed by `emptyDir`, and that existing volume was kept with `sizeLimit: 512Mi` when needed.
- Existing memory-backed `/dev/shm` volumes were preserved as-is. No new `/tmp` mount was introduced.

### Kubernetes limitations and scope boundaries

- Standard Kubernetes pod specs do not expose per-mount `noexec`, `nosuid`, or `nodev` flags for normal container volume mounts, so those controls cannot be represented honestly in these manifests.
- Log rotation and log size limiting are node or container-runtime controls, typically configured through kubelet and the runtime.
- They are not workload-scoped manifest controls, so they are documented here rather than added as a per-workload matrix column.

### Existing workload-specific caveats preserved

- `epicgames-freegames` still cannot use `runAsNonRoot` or `readOnlyRootFilesystem` with the current image behavior.
- `plex` still cannot use `capabilities.drop: ["ALL"]` with the current image behavior.
- `bitwarden-restore` and `mealie-restore` remain manual restore job manifests kept in git and not intended for deployment by default.
- `netbootxyz` and `iventoy` required `readOnlyRootFilesystem` to be reverted after rollout verification exposed startup writes in the current images.
- `jellyfin` retains its commented one-time ownership migration init container.

## Deferred overlays

These are overlay patches for operator/third-party workloads and were intentionally not
force-hardened at overlay level:

- `kubernetes/cluster-bootstrap/cert-manager/cert-manager-cainjector-patch.yaml`
- `kubernetes/cluster-bootstrap/cert-manager/cert-manager-patch.yaml`
- `kubernetes/cluster-bootstrap/cert-manager/cert-manager-webhook-patch.yaml`
- `kubernetes/cluster-bootstrap/kube-vip/kube-vip-cloud-provider-patch.yaml`
- `kubernetes/cluster-bootstrap/reflector/reflector-patch.yaml`
- `kubernetes/metrics-server/kubelet-serving-cert-approver-patch.yaml`
- `kubernetes/metrics-server/metrics-server-patch.yaml`
- `kubernetes/portainer-agent/portainer-agent-patch.yaml`
- `kubernetes/tailscale/tailscale-operator-patch-deployment.yaml`
- `kubernetes/traefik/traefik-deployment-patch.yaml`

Deferred rationale:

- Drift risk with upstream chart/operator updates
- Potential behavior regressions in control-plane components
- Need rendered-manifest audit (`kubectl kustomize ...`) for accurate final posture
